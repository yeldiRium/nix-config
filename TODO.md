# TODO

- darwin
  - [ ] store gpg-agent passphrase in keychain
- apps
  - cli
    - neovim
      - [ ] maybe indent entire editor based on screen size? I'd like to have my code more centered
      - [ ] folding does not work correctly for yaml lists, only folds the first entry, if its an object
      - features
        - obsidian
          - [ ] add keybindings
          - [ ] add custom template substitutions until all of my templates work
          - [ ] maybe somehow support dataview? this might be a limitation
      - syntax highlighting
        - [ ] css
        - [ ] csv
        - [ ] desktop
        - [ ] gitignore
        - [ ] html
        - [ ] make
        - [ ] regex
        - [ ] scss
        - [ ] sh/bash
        - [ ] sql
        - [ ] ssh_config
        - [ ] terraform
        - [ ] toml
        - [ ] xml
      - lsp
        - [ ] html
        - [ ] htmx
        - [ ] terraformls
      - dap
          - [ ] javascript, typescript
  - desktop apps
    - [ ] audacity
    - [ ] transmission gui
    - office
      - mail
        - [ ] add missing accounts, but probably put them into sops so not all my e-mail account names are visible to the public
- fixes
- security
  - [ ] look into full disk encryption (might require re-setup)
  - [ ] setup sops
    - [ ] for ssh key
    - [ ] for gpg key
- darwin
- modularity
  - [ ] refactor creation of scripts - multiple places have function definitions to create script packages
  - [ ] move home manager modules out of home, make user name configurable
    - [ ] move desktops and autostart into yeldirs.desktop configuration
  - [ ] rethink the "supported languages" support in my module options
    - The list becomes very long and clutters the config
    - I might want to cluster some languages, e.g. json/yaml/xml/csv because they are related, but they might have complicated setups
    - [ ] invert how support for programming languages is structured
      - instead of having language support distributed across many files (neovim lsp, treesitter, other installations), each programming language or development feature should have one module
      - this module contains configurations for all other programs (neovim, install additional things, shell integrations) depending on whether they are installed

## Restructure development feature
- feature
  - editor integration
    - neovim config
      - ftplugin (filetype specific settings)
      - treesitter plugin (syntax highlighting)
      - lsp binding
      - neotest plugin (testing)
      - dap plugin (debugging)
      - linter plugin
      - custom keybinds
      - custom plugins
  - specific software
    - eg docker, kubectl
    - language server
    - debugger
    - linter
    - no interpreters or compilers, those should be installed via devbox with the project-specific version
    - scripts and aliases
  - shell integration
  - system daemons
- what features are there?
  - essential (nix, isd)
  - go (treesitter, lsp, dap, test plugin)
  - lua (treesitter, lsp)
  - git (gitignore, gitconfig, gh)
  - shell (sh, bash, zsh, treesitter, lsp)
  - markdown (treesitter, lsp?)
  - web (typescript, javascript, html, css, scss)
  - docker (docker, lazydocker)
  - kubernetes (kubectl, kubectx & kubens, k9s, helm)
  - minikube
  - config/data files (json, csv, xml, yaml, toml)
  - linux (desktop files)
  - regex
  - poe (treesitter)
  - hledger (hledger, my scripts, treesitter, lsp)
  - rego (treesitter, lsp)
  - ? terraform (highlighting, lsp?, cli)
  - ? make (makefile highlighting & lsp?, make cli)
