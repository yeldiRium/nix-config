      - rss
        - [ ] manage RSS feeds in thunderbird by generating `feeds.json`. this might not work, since thunderbird wants to write the file
      - hledger

  - [ ] setup sops
    - [x] for user password
    - [ ] for ssh key
    - [ ] for gpg key
    - [-] for wifi network
  - backups with borg
    - [ ] configurable per host
    - [ ] with impermanence it's easy to just backup the entire /persist folder
- darwin
- modularity
  - [x] add options to disable animations and transparency in hyprland and wayland
  - [x] make impermanence optional
  - [ ] invert how support for programming languages is structured
    - instead of having language support distributed across many files (neovim lsp, treesitter, other installations), each programming language or development feature should have one module
    - this module contains configurations for all other programs (neovim, install additional things, shell integrations) depending on whether they are installed
  - [ ] make system target configurable between linux and darwin
    - [ ] use it to build the shell aliases for nbuild/nswitch/nrepl
  - [ ] rethink the "supported languages" support in my module options
    - The list becomes very long and clutters the config
    - I might want to cluster some languages, e.g. json/yaml/xml/csv because they are related, but they might have complicated setups

## Restructure development feature
- feature
  - editor integration
    - lsp software
    - neovim config
      - ftplugin (filetype specific settings)
      - treesitter plugin (syntax highlighting)
      - dap plugin (debugging)
      - lsp binding
      - neotest plugin (testing)
  - specific software
    - eg docker, kubectl
    - no interpreters or compilers, those should be installed via devbox with the project-specific version
    - scripts and aliases
  - shell integration
- what features are there?
  - go (highlighting, lsp, dap, test plugin)
  - lua (highlighting, lsp)
  - git (gitignore, gitconfig, gh)
  - shell (sh, bash, zsh)
  - web (typescript, javascript, html, css, scss)
  - docker (docker, lazydocker)
  - kubernetes (kubectl, k9s, helm)
  - minikube
  - config/data files (json, csv, xml, yaml, toml)
  - terraform (highlighting, lsp?, cli)
  - make (makefile highlighting & lsp?, make cli)
  - linux (desktop files)
  - regex
