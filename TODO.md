        - [x] bashls
        - [ ] helm?

        - [ ] terraformls
      - dap
          - [ ] javascript, typescript
  - desktop apps
    - [ ] audacity
    - [ ] clementine
    - [ ] gimp
    - [ ] transmission gui
    - office
      - mail
        - [ ] add missing accounts, but probably put them into sops so not all my e-mail account names are visible to the public
      - rss
        - [ ] manage RSS feeds in thunderbird by generating `feeds.json`. this might not work, since thunderbird wants to write the file
      - hledger
        - [ ] check config against hackstack. strict checking does not seem to work
- fixes
    - [ ] home manager switch: delete zsh_history file before starting service home-manager-yeldir
    - [x] still "too many open files" errors when starting games (e.g. kingdoms of amalur)
- security
  - [ ] look into full disk encryption (might require re-setup)
  - [ ] setup sops
    - [x] for user password
    - [ ] for ssh key
    - [ ] for gpg key
    - [-] for wifi network
  - backups with borg
    - [ ] configurable per host
    - [ ] with impermanence it's easy to just backup the entire /persist folder
- darwin
- modularity
  - [x] add options to disable animations and transparency in hyprland and wayland
  - [x] make impermanence optional
  - [ ] make system target configurable between linux and darwin
    - [ ] use it to build the shell aliases for nbuild/nswitch/nrepl
  - [ ] rethink the "supported languages" support in my module options
    - The list becomes very long and clutters the config
    - I might want to cluster some languages, e.g. json/yaml/xml/csv because they are related, but they might have complicated setups
