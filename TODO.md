  - [ ] setup sops
    - [x] for user password
    - [ ] for ssh key
    - [ ] for gpg key
    - [-] for wifi network
  - backups with borg
    - [ ] configurable per host
    - [ ] with impermanence it's easy to just backup the entire /persist folder
- darwin
- modularity
  - [x] add options to disable animations and transparency in hyprland and wayland
  - [x] make impermanence optional
  - [ ] make system target configurable between linux and darwin
    - [ ] use it to build the shell aliases for nbuild/nswitch/nrepl
  - [ ] rethink the "supported languages" support in my module options
    - The list becomes very long and clutters the config
    - I might want to cluster some languages, e.g. json/yaml/xml/csv because they are related, but they might have complicated setups
